I find myself doing this from time to time as well, either out of laziness or because I’ve run into something quirky. Have you noticed how the ProductRepository::Save() method requires the product exist first? Quirky right? This will be the first post in a small series of posts on How to bla bla entities. We’re m... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Xdebug 3 and Magento 2</title><link href="https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Xdebug-3-and-Magento-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Xdebug 3 and Magento 2" /><published>2021-09-09T13:20:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-10-22T07:26:07-04:00</updated> <id>https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Xdebug-3-and-Magento-2/</id> <content src="https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Xdebug-3-and-Magento-2/" /> <author> <name>Bwilliamson</name> </author> <category term="Magento" /> <category term="Dev" /> <summary> Xdebug - you should use it Xdebug is an extension for PHP, and provides a range of features to improve the PHP development experience. This post will focus on the feature we use most often - Step Debugging as well as configuration, installation, and a bit of Magento 2. Xdebug 2 vs 3 Xdebug 3 made a lot of great improvements over Xdebug 2.

Before 2.3, Magento used Install and Upgrade scripts to modify your schema, and other things. This has been deprecated in favor of a much easier (I think) declaration schema. This new mess of stuff is outlined here. This is closely related, but not the topic at hand. It’s worth mentioning, because of the mountain of old information out there using the pre-2.3 met... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Transfer Exchange message tracking logs to Mysql with Talend Open Studio</title><link href="https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Transfer-Exchange-message-tracking-logs-to-Mysql-with-Talend-Open-Studio/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Transfer Exchange message tracking logs to Mysql with Talend Open Studio" /><published>2021-08-22T19:31:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-08-22T19:31:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Transfer-Exchange-message-tracking-logs-to-Mysql-with-Talend-Open-Studio/</id> <content src="https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Transfer-Exchange-message-tracking-logs-to-Mysql-with-Talend-Open-Studio/" /> <author> <name>Bwilliamson</name> </author> <category term="ETL" /> <category term="Talend" /> <summary> In short, we are pushing a csv into a database on a schedule using Talend Open Studio as our ETL tool. For this post though, we’re getting specific with exchange tracking logs, as this was a fun task I had once so it’s a real world example. I did a short post about how I generated the csv here. The following is a step by step overview. I suppose it could substitute for a hands-on crash course... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Extract Exchange message tracking logs with powershell</title><link href="https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Extract-Exchange-message-tracking-logs-with-powershell/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Extract Exchange message tracking logs with powershell" /><published>2021-08-22T19:17:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-08-22T19:17:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Extract-Exchange-message-tracking-logs-with-powershell/</id> <content src="https://bwilliamson55.github.io/posts/Extract-Exchange-message-tracking-logs-with-powershell/" /> <author> <name>Bwilliamson</name> </author> <category term="Sysadmin" /> <category term="Powershell" /> <summary> Exchange makes it kind of difficult to do complicated reporting without third party tools. This post will show how to extract the message logs useful data.
