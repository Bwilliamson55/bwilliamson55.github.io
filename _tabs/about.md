# Hi! This is my blog.


## What?


I keep this as a sort of wiki and how-to guide for future me, on various useful topics.
Generally I keep my notes and how-to guides in Evernote, but there's a lot of content worth sharing.
The content here is largely the ramblings of a full stack Magento engineer, and previous Sysadmin. I am qualified to ramble, I think.

## Why?

Finding solutions to problems and curiosities is the most satisfying feeling. When you finally build a way from A to B and it ***works***. Hopefully this content helps you achieve that, just as a good deal of content out there has done that for me.


I plan to leave notes on a lot of topics I find useful and interesting:


* Powershell
* Magento 2 (A lot of this)
* PHP
* Web Development
* Microsoft server management
* Data pools
* ETL and Databases
* Linux
* General Sysadmin for small to medium business

As a secondary objective, this serves as a portfolio.
I would encourage any prospective employers or connections to browse this blog and review the types of challenges I encounter, and the solutions I use or create. In my experience, one thing a CV cannot do thoroughly is ***show*** the work.
