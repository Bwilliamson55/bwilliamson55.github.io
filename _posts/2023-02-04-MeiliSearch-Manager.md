# So I built this thingy

[Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) is an open source, drop in, direct replacement for Algolia. A lot like Klevu, this tool allows us to stand up a powerful search and index engine to make our frontend experiences better.

Meilisearch uses the same open source library as algolia - so most of the code in your frontend is identical if you switch from one to the other. This is super handy because of the [great docs algolia maintains for these components.](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/widgets/showcase/vue/)

The downside is the platform doesn't have a full featured GUI like Klevu or Algolia. That being said, I'm working on changing that for the learns.

## Video !

As a way to better share ideas and knowledge, I've started using various video platforms to record some things. This should help condense a lot of writing in these posts moving forward.

This post is mostly a test to see if an embeded video will work the way I expect, but also to show something I built last week, and have been tinkering with. This video was aimed at work colleages, but nothing work specific besides a few acronyms was mentioned or shown.
